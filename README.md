# Telecommunication-Churn-Rate
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze churn behavior among over 7,000 telecom customers and the driver for customer churn.
The project explored key metrics such as churn rate, revenue loss, internet service types, payment methods, and contract durations. Using slicers like Tech Support and Churn status, the analysis revealed strong links between lack of support and higher churn rates, offering actionable insights to improve customer retention and business performance.
