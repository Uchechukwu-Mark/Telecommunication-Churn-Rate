**Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI Dashboard)**

In this project, I developed an interactive Customer Churn Dashboard using Power BI to analyze a telecommunications dataset of over 7,000 customers. The dashboard leverages dynamic slicers ‚Äî particularly Tech Support and Churn status ‚Äî to uncover patterns driving customer attrition and potential revenue loss.

**üîç Key Business Insights:** 
**Churn Rate & Volume:**

Identified a total of 1869 churned customers (approx. 26.58% of total), indicating a significant retention challenge.

Customers without Tech Support services showed a markedly higher churn rate of 41.65%, suggesting a strong link between poor after-sales support and attrition.

**Revenue Impact:**
The total revenue from all customers was $16.06M, with an estimated $2.86M lost due to churn.

This translates to a 17.83% revenue loss, signaling a need to prioritize retention strategies for high-value customers.

**Customer Segmentation:**
Customers with Fiber optic internet churned at a higher rate than those with DSL or no internet service, possibly due to pricing or service expectations.
A bar chart of tenure bins showed that customers with less than 1 year of engagement were more likely to churn ‚Äî indicating a vulnerable onboarding phase.


**Payment Method & Gender:**

A Tree Map revealed that churn was higher among customers using electronic check with a concerning 31.7% churn, hinting at possible potential friction in payment experience.

Gender appeared relatively balanced across churn behavior, as shown in a donut chart.

**Contract Type:**

Month-to-month contracts had the highest churn percentage, whereas customers on 1- or 2-year contracts showed more loyalty ‚Äî highlighting the value of long-term commitments.

**üß† Strategic Recommendation:**
The dashboard provides strong evidence that Tech Support availability is a critical driver of churn. Improving support touchpoints, particularly for new customers and those on flexible contracts, could reduce churn and improve lifetime value.
